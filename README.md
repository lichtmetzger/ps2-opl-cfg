# ps2-opl-cfg
This is a collection of CFG files for use with Open PS2 Loader.

When I filled up my PlayStation 2 with 2 terabytes of games (also including PS1 games) I wanted them to show up correctly in OPL, so I created these files in a few days.

I added game titles, release dates, developers, ESRB/PEGI/USK ratings and the number of players.
Information about the game resolution is mostly omitted, because these are difficult to research.

This data comes mostly from mobygames.com, although I've truncated or rewritten game descriptions in a lot of places because of the 255 character limit.

Pull requests are welcome!
